# Github Pages

## What are Github Pages?
Github Pages use a special repository in your github profile which serves as a website. You can find this website at \<your user name\>.github.io

We are going to use it to create a very basic landing page for our portfolio. This way we can get started on your ability to showcase your work! We need people know you are putting in the work!

## Getting started

Click on the following guide to get started on your github.io website: [Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

This will let us at least get started.

Go to the _config.yml file. This is kind of like the settings for your website. For now, change the `title` to your name.

## First Branch

We are going to practice branching our github.io website and building out a feature.

Go to the repository page for your website and click on the "branches".
